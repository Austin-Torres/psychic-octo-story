There once was a state made of cheese. It was in the north and it produced all things dairy. All you could see for miles and miles were
farms and factories of cheese. Without it, the world would be cheeseless and sad. No one wants a cheeseless world. Except, of course, 
Dr.Lactoseintollerant. Dr.Lactoseintollerant is the most evil man in the world, hellbent on eliminating all cheese from the world.
He newest invention, the Nocheese machine was a machine unlike any other. And I'll describe it in excrusiating detail now.

The machine has a vision and smell detector on it. Once cheeese is either found or smelled by the machine, it will automatically suck everything in including stuff that's irrelevent around the machine. It will stop the sucking process once there are no signs of cheese around the machine. After that, the machine will just keep moving until it finds another cheese.
